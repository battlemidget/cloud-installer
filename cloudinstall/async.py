""" Async Handler
Provides async operations for various api calls and other non-blocking
work.

The way this works is you create your IO/CPU bound thread:

.. code::

    def my_async_method(self):
        pool.submit(func, *args)

    # In your controller you would then call

    my_async_method_f = my_async_method()
    my_async_method_f.add_done_callback(self.handle_async_method)

    def handle_async_method(self, future):
        try:
            result = future.result()
        except Exception as e:
            raise Exception("Program in thread {}".format(e))

"""

from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor


class Async:
    pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(10)
